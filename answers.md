## 1 - Explain the money flow and the information flow in the acquirer market and the role of the main players.

In the context of the acquirer market, in summary, we have the following:

1. The customer begins the process when they make a purchase.
2. Money is passed from the customer to the commercial establishment in the form of payment (credit or debit in most cases).
3. The acquiring company will receive the transaction data and "talk" to the card brand company.
4. The card brand (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) informs whether there is a balance for such a transaction.
5. The acquirer receives the money from the card company, and the establishment will receive the money from the acquirer if the transaction is approved.

## 2 - Explain the difference between acquirer, sub-acquirer, and payment gateway and how the flow explained in question 1 changes for these players.

- **Acquirer:** They are like intermediaries that help commercial establishments accept card payments. They handle financial transactions and connect the merchant to card issuers (customer banks).

- **Sub-acquirer:** Buyers' assistants. They also help commercial establishments but work under a master acquirer. These are usually smaller (regional) banks or fintechs.

- **Payment Gateway:** They are like gatekeepers who help pass payment information back and forth. Payment gateways connect the merchant to acquirers or sub-acquirers, allowing payment information to flow securely.

## 3 - Explain what chargebacks are, how they differ from cancellations, and what is their connection with fraud in the acquiring world.

- **Chargebacks:** A chargeback occurs when a cardholder contacts their card issuer to dispute a transaction. These disputes generally concern fraud, double billing, etc.

- **Cancellations:** Cancellations are processes in which the merchant or acquirer themselves interrupt a transaction before it is fully processed. Usually due to data inconsistency or technical problems.

- **Connection to Fraud:** Chargebacks are directly related to fraud, as one of the main reasons for chargebacks is credit card fraud.
